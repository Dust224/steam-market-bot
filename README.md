**High-frequency trading of items on the Steam Community Market (http://steamcommunity.com/market/),
a market for virtual items made for the Steam platform.**

splinter is needed for the software to run, and can be downloaded at: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/splinter,
or by using the command 'pip install splinter'.

UPDATE: No longer puts items back into the market (at market price) automatically. The market (server-side) is under constant developement, and the risk of failure is therefore too high.

UPDATE 2: This program is no longer under active developement, and is for this reason out-of-date. It is most likely still functional, but use with great care.
